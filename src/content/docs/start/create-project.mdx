One thing that makes Tauri so flexible is its ability to work with virtually any frontend framework. We've created the [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app) utility to help you create a new Tauri project using one of the officially maintained framework templates.

`create-tauri-app` currently includes templates for vanilla (HTML, CSS and JavaScript without a framework), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Yew](https://yew.rs/), [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos), and [Sycamore](https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/). You can also find or add your own community templates and frameworks in the [Awesome Tauri repo](https://github.com/tauri-apps/awesome-tauri).

{/* TODO: redirect to integrate to existing front-end project specific docs */}
Alternatively, you can [add Tauri to an existing project](#manual-setup-tauri-cli) to quickly turn your existing codebase into a Tauri app.

## Using `create-tauri-app`

To get started using `create-tauri-app` run one of the below commands in the folder you'd like to setup your project. If you're not sure which command to use we recommend the Bash command on Linux and macOS and the PowerShell command on Windows.

<Cta />

Follow along with the prompts to choose your project name, frontend language, package manager, and frontend framework, and frontend framework options if applicable.

:::tip[Not sure what to choose?]

{/* TODO: redirect to integrate to existing front-end project specific docs */}
We recommend starting with the vanilla template (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a frontend framework) to get started. You can always [integrate a frontend framework](/start/create-project/) later.

- Choose which language to use for your frontend: `TypeScript / JavaScript`
- Choose your package manager: `pnpm`
- Choose your UI template: `Vanilla`
- Choose your UI flavor: `TypeScript`

:::

#### Scaffold a new project

<Steps>

1. Choose a name and a bundle identifier (unique-id for your app):
   ```
   ? Project name (tauri-app) â€º
   ? Identifier (com.tauri-app.app) â€º
   ```
2. Select a flavor for your frontend. First the language:
   ```
   ? Choose which language to use for your frontend â€º
   Rust  (cargo)
   TypeScript / JavaScript  (pnpm, yarn, npm, bun)
   .NET  (dotnet)
   ```
3. Select a package manager (if there are multiple available):

   Options for **TypeScript / JavaScript**:

   ```
   ? Choose your package manager â€º
   pnpm
   yarn
   npm
   bun
   ```

4. Select a UI Template and flavor (if there are multiple available):

   Options for **Rust**:

   ```
   ? Choose your UI template â€º
   Vanilla
   Yew
   Leptos
   Sycamore
   ```

   Options for **TypeScript / JavaScript**:

   ```
   ? Choose your UI template â€º
   Vanilla
   Vue
   Svelte
   React
   Solid
   Angular
   Preact

   ? Choose your UI flavor â€º
   TypeScript
   JavaScript
   ```

   Options for **.NET**:

   ```
   ? Choose your UI template â€º
   Blazor  (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor/)
   ```

</Steps>

Once completed, the utility reports that the template has been created and displays how to run it using the configured package manager. If it detects missing dependencies on your system, it prints a list of packages and prompts how to install them.

{/* TODO: Can CTA offer to install the deps? */}

#### Start the development server

After `create-tauri-app` has complete you can navigate into your project's folder, install dependencies, then use the [Tauri CLI](/reference/cli/) to start the development server:

import CommandTabs from '@components/CommandTabs.astro';

<CommandTabs
  npm="cd tauri-app
    npm install
    npm run tauri dev"
  yarn="cd tauri-app
    yarn install
    yarn tauri dev"
  pnpm="cd tauri-app
    pnpm install
    pnpm tauri dev"
  deno="cd tauri-app
    deno install
    deno task tauri dev"
  cargo="cd tauri-app
    cargo tauri dev"
/>

You'll now see a new window open with your app running.

**Congratulations!** You've made your Tauri app! ðŸš€

## Manual Setup (Tauri CLI)

If you already have an existing frontend or prefer to set it up yourself, you can use the Tauri CLI to initialize the backend for your project separately.

:::note
The following example assumes you are creating a new project. If you've already initialized the frontend of your application, you can skip the first step.
:::

<Steps>

    1. Create a new directory for your project and initialize the frontend. You can use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or any framework you prefer such as Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, Yew, or Leptos. You just need a way of serving the app in your browser. Just as an example, this is how you would setup a simple Vite app:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="mkdir tauri-app
                cd tauri-app
                npm create vite@latest ."
            yarn="mkdir tauri-app
                cd tauri-app
                yarn create vite ."
            pnpm="mkdir tauri-app
                cd tauri-app
                pnpm create vite ."
            deno="mkdir tauri-app
                cd tauri-app
                deno run -A npm:create-vite ."
        />

    2. Then, install Tauri's CLI tool using your package manager of choice. If you are using `cargo` to install the Tauri CLI, you will have to install it globally.

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npm install -D @tauri-apps/cli@latest"
            yarn="yarn add -D @tauri-apps/cli@latest"
            pnpm="pnpm add -D @tauri-apps/cli@latest"
            deno="deno add -D npm:@tauri-apps/cli@latest"
            cargo='cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0.0" --locked'
        />

    3. Determine the URL of your frontend development server. This is the URL that Tauri will use to load your content. For example, if you are using Vite, the default URL is `http://localhost:5173`.

    4. In your project directory, initialize Tauri:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npx tauri init"
            yarn="yarn tauri init"
            pnpm="pnpm tauri init"
            deno="deno task tauri init"
            cargo="cargo tauri init"
        />

        After running the command it will display a prompt asking you for different options:

        ```sh frame=none
        âœ” What is your app name? tauri-app
        âœ” What should the window title be? tauri-app
        âœ” Where are your web assets located? ..
        âœ” What is the url of your dev server? http://localhost:5173
        âœ” What is your frontend dev command? pnpm run dev
        âœ” What is your frontend build command? pnpm run build
        ```

        This will create a `src-tauri` directory in your project with the necessary Tauri configuration files.

    5. Verify your Tauri app is working by running the development server:

        <CommandTabs
            npm="npx tauri dev"
            yarn="yarn tauri dev"
            pnpm="pnpm tauri dev"
            deno="deno task tauri dev"
            cargo="cargo tauri dev"
        />

        This command will compile the Rust code and open a window with your web content.

</Steps>

**Congratulations!** You've created a new Tauri project using the Tauri CLI! ðŸš€
